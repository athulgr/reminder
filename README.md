# 😈 The Alter Ego: Compulsion-Driven Reminder System 

**Version:** 1.0 (Chat-First Reminders & Erasure Protocol)

---

## About

**The  Alter Ego** is a unique, high-intensity web application designed to enforce daily compliance and motivation through psychological pressure. Unlike traditional supportive reminder apps, APEX leverages a **hostile Future Self persona** to deliver tasks, motivation, and guilt-trips exclusively through a chat-centric interface.

This app is not for the faint of heart—it’s built to push users to achieve their most ambitious goals through **fear, guilt, and relentless accountability**.

## Core Concept: The Hostile Future Self 🤖

The success  lies in the ** Alter Ego Persona**—an AI that embodies the user’s most accomplished future self.  

- **Tone:** Insulting, cutting, direct, and authoritative. The AI is intentionally programmatically locked to resist friendliness.  
- **Motivation:** All reminders, task settings, and feedback are delivered through aggressive, high-contrast chat messages designed to compel action.

## The Erasure Protocol

The **Erasure Protocol** is the heart of APEX’s psychological drive:  

- Tasks left incomplete trigger guilt-trips and countdown adjustments.  
- The **Future Self Countdown** visually represents the user’s progress and potential failure.  
- Every missed task results in simulated **degradation of the future**, reinforcing the consequences of inaction.  

This system ensures users remain **relentlessly accountable** to themselves, gamifying compliance with high stakes and psychological tension.

## Deployment

The APEX Alter Ego web app is built with **React** and **Vite** for fast, responsive performance and is fully deployable on **GitHub Pages**.
